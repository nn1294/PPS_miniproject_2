The Restaurant Billing System is a C program designed to manage and automate the billing process for a restaurant. The program facilitates the entry of customer orders, calculates the total bill, applies discounts based on the total amount spent, and provides an organized summary of the transaction. The key features and functionalities of the program include:

1. **User-Friendly Menu Display:**
   The program begins by displaying a user-friendly menu that showcases various meals along with their corresponding prices. This ensures clarity for customers while placing their orders.

2. **Order Placement:**
   Users are prompted to input the number of adults and children in their party. They are then guided through the process of placing orders for different menu items, specifying the quantity of each item.

3. **Order Processing for Adults:**
   The system handles adult orders, allowing customers to choose from the menu, enter the quantity of each item, and calculates the total cost for the adult meals. It considers a tax rate on the total adult order.

4. **Order Processing for Children:**
   Similar to adult orders, the program manages the ordering process for children. It applies a discount to the prices of each item for children and calculates the total cost, including a tax rate on the total child order.

5. **Discount Structure:**
   The program incorporates a dynamic discount structure based on the total bill amount. Customers receive higher discounts for larger orders, incentivizing them to spend more. The discount rates are tiered, encouraging increased spending for enhanced savings.

6. **Final Billing and Summary:**
   After processing both adult and child orders, the program calculates the total bill, applies applicable discounts, and presents the final bill to the customer. The final bill includes a detailed summary of the order, displaying the number of adults and children, individual and total costs, applied discounts, and the discounted total.

7. **User Interaction and Continuity:**
   The program allows users to decide whether to continue placing orders for additional parties. It maintains an interactive and iterative process, enabling users to enter orders for multiple groups.

8. **Thank-You Message:**
   Upon completion of the ordering process, the program displays a thank-you message, expressing gratitude to the customers for their patronage. It also encourages them to visit the restaurant again.

The Restaurant Billing System demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as input/output operations, conditional statements, loops, functions, and modular programming. It serves as an illustrative example of how a billing system can be implemented in C to streamline and enhance the efficiency of restaurant transactions.
